# Symply 🌼

**Symply** is a beautifully simple, privacy-first symptom tracking app designed especially for underdiagnosed and neurodivergent people.  
It empowers users to log physical, emotional, cognitive, and sensory symptoms — and helps them identify patterns, manage their health, and advocate for themselves with clarity and confidence.
